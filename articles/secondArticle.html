    <h2>5. Snape choosing the Dark Arts</h2>
    <p>Oh Snape – his life was really quite tragic. He was bullied at school, lost the (unrequited) love of his life
        and died protecting the son Lily left behind. The Prince's tale is a sad one, but Snape made a lot of
        questionable choices and his obsession with the Dark Arts cost him an awful lot.</p>
    <p>Snape was obsessed with hexes and curses from when he was young, and we can understand why, to some degree.
        Being unloved by your parents and tormented by your classmates is sure to have an impact on anyone. Yet,
        Snape was not completely without love – he had Lily. If he really wanted to protect that relationship, he
        could have.</p>
    <p>When he saw that Lily was getting close to his nemesis James Potter, he pushed her even further away and
        strengthened his bonds with a group of dodgy Slytherins – who were also obsessed with the Dark Arts and on
        their way to becoming Death Eaters. It was his inability to let go of that obsession that cost him Lily and
        ultimately sent him down a dark and dangerous path.</p>
    <h2>4. Ron deciding to leave the Horcrux hunt</h2>
    <p>When Ron decided to leave the hunt for Horcruxes he really hurt Harry and Hermione. Not only did he allow
        jealousy to get the better of him, but he also refused to consider that the Horcrux might be the reason he
        was feeling that way. His stubbornness and insecurity allowed him to abandon his friends – a decision he
        would come to deeply regret.</p>
    <p>While Ron was away, Harry and Hermione found themselves in a bad place, ending with their trip to Godric’s
        Hollow where Nagini created a harrowing experience for them. If Ron had been there, he might have been able
        to prevent Harry’s wand from breaking or may have even stopped them from going in the first place. While we
        don’t know what would have happened if Ron stayed, we do know that this decision to leave only made things
        harder. It’s just lucky that Dumbledore had left him his Deluminator – otherwise there would have been no
        coming back from that choice.</p>
    <h2>3. Harry casting one of the Half-Blood Prince's curses on Draco</h2>
    <p>Harry should have listened to Hermione. He should have listened to Ginny. In fact, Harry should have listened
        to anyone who raised concerns about his faith in the Half-Blood Prince. Despite having tackled Tom Riddle’s
        diary in his second year – Harry still wouldn’t listen to those who begged him to use caution when it came
        to trusting an unknown author. What Harry should not have done is use a homemade spell ‘for enemies’ on
        Draco Malfoy.</p>
    <p>While he wasn’t aware of just how horrific or bloody Sectumsempra was, it was still his choice to use it and
        still his fault that Malfoy ended up seriously maimed on the bathroom floor. Now, we know Harry and Malfoy
        weren’t close, but Harry was not a violent person (his signature spell is Expelliarmus after all) and this
        terrible decision weighed heavily on him. Not only did he have to face detention, but also the angry faces
        of the Gryffindor Quidditch team when they found out he was temporarily off the team. Although, Harry did
        learn a lesson from this incident – but what a miniscule silver lining.</p>
    <h2>2. Harry deciding to go to the Department of Mysteries</h2>
    <p>Sometimes there really is no getting through to Harry. Despite multiple people imploring him to take
        Occlumency seriously, he just couldn’t do it. It’s strange, Harry doesn’t normally give up at the first
        hurdle – but for some reason, Occlumency continued to trip him up. Having Snape as his teacher certainly
        didn't help motivate him, either.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, this led him to make a decision he would live to regret. Harry knew that Voldemort could plant
        false images in his brain and knew he shouldn’t trust anything he saw through Voldemort’s eyes. However,
        despite being told this multiple times by multiple people, he was compelled to go anyway – especially as
        this ‘skill’ had enabled him to save Arthur Weasley from Nagini. So, when Voldemort, planted the vision of
        Sirius being tortured in the Department of Mysteries, he decided it must be real. Although Harry meant well,
        his heart often ruled his head.</p>
    <p>As such, not only did he risk his own life, but he also risked his friends’ lives. If Harry hadn’t fallen for
        the set-up, then Sirius wouldn’t have come to the Ministry to rescue him – and we all know how that turned
        out. Ultimately, Voldemort created the perfect trap for Harry - knowing his emotions would outweigh the
        logic. Although a teenager shouldn't be outright blamed for something that Lord Voldemort manipulated,
        Harry’s tragic choice left him without his godfather but with a lifetime of regret.</p>
    <h2>1. Bartemius Crouch smuggling his son out of Azkaban</h2>
    <p>It may seem strange for us to say that this was the worst choice in the wizarding world – but hear us out. We
        believe if it wasn’t for Barty Crouch smuggling his son, Barty Crouch Jr, out of Azkaban, then Voldemort may
        not have returned.</p>
    <p>Barty Crouch may not have been aware of just how devastating the consequences would be when he decided to
        honour his dying wife’s wish. Yet, by freeing Barty Jr he set off a runaway train of events that culminated
        in that awful night of the third Triwizard task. If Barty Jr hadn’t been released, then he wouldn’t have
        managed to overpower his father, kidnap Mad-Eye Moody, take his place, enter Harry into the Triwizard
        Tournament, fix said tournament and finally ensure Harry was deposited in the graveyard where Wormtail could
        use his blood to resurrect the Dark Lord. As far as bad decisions go – this one was certainly up there.</p>
