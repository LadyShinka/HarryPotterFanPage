                <h1>The best choices</h1>
                <p><i>Note: This article is borrowed from Wizarding World. You can see the original one <a
                            href="https://www.wizardingworld.com/features/ranked-the-best-and-worst-decisions-of-the-wizarding-world">here</a>.</i>

                <h2>5. Harry deciding not to be friends with Draco Malfoy</h2>
                <p>You may think that Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy were enemies from the word go. And while it is true that
                    Harry never warmed to him, it didn’t stop Malfoy from trying to collect the famous Boy Who Lived as a
                    friend. However, despite being an 11-year-old thrown into a new world – Harry was still astute enough to
                    recognise that making friends with Malfoy wasn’t the best idea.</p>
                <p>From the moment he called Hagrid a savage, to insulting Ron’s family on the Hogwarts Express, Harry saw
                    Malfoy for who he really was and turned him down. We think Harry’s instincts in this situation were spot on
                    – and this decision stopped any chance of him straying down a dark path and strengthened his fledgling bond
                    with Ron.</p>
                <p>You can read our article debating on if there was ever a scenario where this pair could've been friends here.
                </p>
                <h2>4. Dumbledore choosing to step away from Grindelwald</h2>
                <p>While you may think that it was a terrible decision of Albus Dumbledore to associate with such a wizard in
                    the first place, we believe that it was his choice to break away from Grindelwald that should be admired. It
                    is easy to forget that Dumbledore was once a young impressionable man and not the wise headteacher we are
                    familiar with. To him it must have been thrilling to find another wizard as gifted as he was with a vision
                    to change the world for ‘the greater good’. However, after a devastating row, which left his sister Ariana
                    dead, Dumbledore knew that he and Grindelwald had to part ways.</p>
                <p>It is incredibly fortunate that Dumbledore did this. If he hadn’t, he may not have become the great man he
                    was. He also probably would never have fought against Grindelwald and defeated him in their famous duel.
                    Imagine how different the wizarding world would have been if Dumbledore hadn’t seen Grindelwald’s ideas for
                    what they were and had supported him in his quest for wizard domination.</p>
                <h2>3. Hermione deciding to form Dumbledore’s Army</h2>
                <p>Hermione was often full of clever ideas and this one was no exception. From the moment she realised that her
                    and her classmates would not be getting an adequate education she took matters into her own hands. Harry may
                    have ended up being the teacher, but it was Hermione’s decision to create the group in the first place. It
                    was also Hermione’s shrewd thinking and excellent magical ability that enabled them to know which member had
                    betrayed them to Umbridge (those purple pustules on Marietta Edgecombe’s face were nasty but impressive).
                </p>
                <p>Not only did this decision enable many Hogwarts students to keep up with their education – it actually helped
                    them to excel. The fact that so many members could produce a corporeal Patronus, which is an advanced piece
                    of magic, is testament to this. It also meant that when the second wizarding war was on the horizon, they
                    were a group that was as prepared as possible. Without Dumbledore’s Army we doubt someone like Neville would
                    have had the confidence or the ability to fight the way he did. It may have started off as just a club – but
                    it ended up being so much more.</p>
                <h2>2. Harry asking Mrs Weasley for help on platform nine and three-quarters</h2>
                <p>It is safe to say that when Harry and the Weasleys met each other for the first time their impressions of
                    each other were positive. Mrs Weasley even commented on what a polite boy he was, and Harry admired their
                    family dynamic. It was a chance meeting that led to one of the most important friendships in the series.</p>
                <p>But what if Harry hadn’t worked up the courage to ask Mrs Weasley for help? Would things be different? If Ron
                    hadn’t seen Harry on that platform – would he have asked to share his compartment? Would they have bonded in
                    the same way? If Harry had felt he was all alone, would he have been more tempted to accept Draco Malfoy’s
                    offer of friendship? Could that have meant Harry being sorted into Slytherin?</p>
                <p>If Harry hadn’t made that choice, things may have been very different. He may never have become a member of
                    the Weasley family, and he may not have been best friends with Ron (and he might still be stuck between
                    platforms nine and ten at King’s Cross Station.)</p>
                <h2>1. Harry and Ron deciding to warn Hermione about the troll</h2>
                <p>In a similar vein to the previous decision, if Harry and Ron had not decided to risk it all to save Hermione,
                    we may never have had the Golden Trio. If they had stayed away, Hermione would not have seen a different
                    side to Harry and Ron, and they wouldn’t have seen Hermione covering for them with an irate Professor
                    McGonagall. There is no doubt that their famous bond was forged in the girls’ bathroom with a snotty,
                    unconscious mountain troll lying at their feet.</p>
                <p>While it was Ron’s mean comments that lead to Hermione crying in the loos in the first place, it did pave the
                    way for their eventual friendship. Just imagine how different things would have been if they hadn’t made
                    that choice. Firstly, Hermione might have met her end only a few weeks into her new life as a witch. Even if
                    she had survived, we doubt she would want anything to do with the boys who made her so miserable in the
                    first place.</p>
                <p>We also wonder whether it would have led to Voldemort’s victory. It was Hermione that provided Harry and Ron
                    with key information about Nicolas Flamel and it took all three of them to make it past the obstacles to the
                    Philosopher’s Stone. So, while it was an… unusual start to a friendship, we are secretly grateful for that
                    troll.</p>
