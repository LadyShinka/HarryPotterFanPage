    <h2>5. Harry deciding not to be friends with Draco Malfoy</h2>
    <p>You may think that Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy were enemies from the word go. And while it is true that
        Harry never warmed to him, it didn’t stop Malfoy from trying to collect the famous Boy Who Lived as a
        friend. However, despite being an 11-year-old thrown into a new world – Harry was still astute enough to
        recognise that making friends with Malfoy wasn’t the best idea.</p>
    <p>From the moment he called Hagrid a savage, to insulting Ron’s family on the Hogwarts Express, Harry saw
        Malfoy for who he really was and turned him down. We think Harry’s instincts in this situation were spot on
        – and this decision stopped any chance of him straying down a dark path and strengthened his fledgling bond
        with Ron.</p>
    <p>You can read our article debating on if there was ever a scenario where this pair could've been friends here.
    </p>
    <h2>4. Dumbledore choosing to step away from Grindelwald</h2>
    <p>While you may think that it was a terrible decision of Albus Dumbledore to associate with such a wizard in
        the first place, we believe that it was his choice to break away from Grindelwald that should be admired. It
        is easy to forget that Dumbledore was once a young impressionable man and not the wise headteacher we are
        familiar with. To him it must have been thrilling to find another wizard as gifted as he was with a vision
        to change the world for ‘the greater good’. However, after a devastating row, which left his sister Ariana
        dead, Dumbledore knew that he and Grindelwald had to part ways.</p>
    <p>It is incredibly fortunate that Dumbledore did this. If he hadn’t, he may not have become the great man he
        was. He also probably would never have fought against Grindelwald and defeated him in their famous duel.
        Imagine how different the wizarding world would have been if Dumbledore hadn’t seen Grindelwald’s ideas for
        what they were and had supported him in his quest for wizard domination.</p>
    <h2>3. Hermione deciding to form Dumbledore’s Army</h2>
    <p>Hermione was often full of clever ideas and this one was no exception. From the moment she realised that her
        and her classmates would not be getting an adequate education she took matters into her own hands. Harry may
        have ended up being the teacher, but it was Hermione’s decision to create the group in the first place. It
        was also Hermione’s shrewd thinking and excellent magical ability that enabled them to know which member had
        betrayed them to Umbridge (those purple pustules on Marietta Edgecombe’s face were nasty but impressive).
    </p>
    <p>Not only did this decision enable many Hogwarts students to keep up with their education – it actually helped
        them to excel. The fact that so many members could produce a corporeal Patronus, which is an advanced piece
        of magic, is testament to this. It also meant that when the second wizarding war was on the horizon, they
        were a group that was as prepared as possible. Without Dumbledore’s Army we doubt someone like Neville would
        have had the confidence or the ability to fight the way he did. It may have started off as just a club – but
        it ended up being so much more.</p>
    <h2>2. Harry asking Mrs Weasley for help on platform nine and three-quarters</h2>
    <p>It is safe to say that when Harry and the Weasleys met each other for the first time their impressions of
        each other were positive. Mrs Weasley even commented on what a polite boy he was, and Harry admired their
        family dynamic. It was a chance meeting that led to one of the most important friendships in the series.</p>
    <p>But what if Harry hadn’t worked up the courage to ask Mrs Weasley for help? Would things be different? If Ron
        hadn’t seen Harry on that platform – would he have asked to share his compartment? Would they have bonded in
        the same way? If Harry had felt he was all alone, would he have been more tempted to accept Draco Malfoy’s
        offer of friendship? Could that have meant Harry being sorted into Slytherin?</p>
    <p>If Harry hadn’t made that choice, things may have been very different. He may never have become a member of
        the Weasley family, and he may not have been best friends with Ron (and he might still be stuck between
        platforms nine and ten at King’s Cross Station.)</p>
    <h2>1. Harry and Ron deciding to warn Hermione about the troll</h2>
    <p>In a similar vein to the previous decision, if Harry and Ron had not decided to risk it all to save Hermione,
        we may never have had the Golden Trio. If they had stayed away, Hermione would not have seen a different
        side to Harry and Ron, and they wouldn’t have seen Hermione covering for them with an irate Professor
        McGonagall. There is no doubt that their famous bond was forged in the girls’ bathroom with a snotty,
        unconscious mountain troll lying at their feet.</p>
    <p>While it was Ron’s mean comments that lead to Hermione crying in the loos in the first place, it did pave the
        way for their eventual friendship. Just imagine how different things would have been if they hadn’t made
        that choice. Firstly, Hermione might have met her end only a few weeks into her new life as a witch. Even if
        she had survived, we doubt she would want anything to do with the boys who made her so miserable in the
        first place.</p>
    <p>We also wonder whether it would have led to Voldemort’s victory. It was Hermione that provided Harry and Ron
        with key information about Nicolas Flamel and it took all three of them to make it past the obstacles to the
        Philosopher’s Stone. So, while it was an… unusual start to a friendship, we are secretly grateful for that
        troll.</p>

    <h1>The worst choices</h1>
    <p><i>Note: This article is borrowed from Wizarding World. You can see the original one <a
                href="https://www.wizardingworld.com/features/ranked-the-best-and-worst-decisions-of-the-wizarding-world">here</a>.</i>
    </p>
    <h2>5. Snape choosing the Dark Arts</h2>
    <p>Oh Snape – his life was really quite tragic. He was bullied at school, lost the (unrequited) love of his life
        and died protecting the son Lily left behind. The Prince's tale is a sad one, but Snape made a lot of
        questionable choices and his obsession with the Dark Arts cost him an awful lot.</p>
    <p>Snape was obsessed with hexes and curses from when he was young, and we can understand why, to some degree.
        Being unloved by your parents and tormented by your classmates is sure to have an impact on anyone. Yet,
        Snape was not completely without love – he had Lily. If he really wanted to protect that relationship, he
        could have.</p>
    <p>When he saw that Lily was getting close to his nemesis James Potter, he pushed her even further away and
        strengthened his bonds with a group of dodgy Slytherins – who were also obsessed with the Dark Arts and on
        their way to becoming Death Eaters. It was his inability to let go of that obsession that cost him Lily and
        ultimately sent him down a dark and dangerous path.</p>
    <h2>4. Ron deciding to leave the Horcrux hunt</h2>
    <p>When Ron decided to leave the hunt for Horcruxes he really hurt Harry and Hermione. Not only did he allow
        jealousy to get the better of him, but he also refused to consider that the Horcrux might be the reason he
        was feeling that way. His stubbornness and insecurity allowed him to abandon his friends – a decision he
        would come to deeply regret.</p>
    <p>While Ron was away, Harry and Hermione found themselves in a bad place, ending with their trip to Godric’s
        Hollow where Nagini created a harrowing experience for them. If Ron had been there, he might have been able
        to prevent Harry’s wand from breaking or may have even stopped them from going in the first place. While we
        don’t know what would have happened if Ron stayed, we do know that this decision to leave only made things
        harder. It’s just lucky that Dumbledore had left him his Deluminator – otherwise there would have been no
        coming back from that choice.</p>
    <h2>3. Harry casting one of the Half-Blood Prince's curses on Draco</h2>
    <p>Harry should have listened to Hermione. He should have listened to Ginny. In fact, Harry should have listened
        to anyone who raised concerns about his faith in the Half-Blood Prince. Despite having tackled Tom Riddle’s
        diary in his second year – Harry still wouldn’t listen to those who begged him to use caution when it came
        to trusting an unknown author. What Harry should not have done is use a homemade spell ‘for enemies’ on
        Draco Malfoy.</p>
    <p>While he wasn’t aware of just how horrific or bloody Sectumsempra was, it was still his choice to use it and
        still his fault that Malfoy ended up seriously maimed on the bathroom floor. Now, we know Harry and Malfoy
        weren’t close, but Harry was not a violent person (his signature spell is Expelliarmus after all) and this
        terrible decision weighed heavily on him. Not only did he have to face detention, but also the angry faces
        of the Gryffindor Quidditch team when they found out he was temporarily off the team. Although, Harry did
        learn a lesson from this incident – but what a miniscule silver lining.</p>
    <h2>2. Harry deciding to go to the Department of Mysteries</h2>
    <p>Sometimes there really is no getting through to Harry. Despite multiple people imploring him to take
        Occlumency seriously, he just couldn’t do it. It’s strange, Harry doesn’t normally give up at the first
        hurdle – but for some reason, Occlumency continued to trip him up. Having Snape as his teacher certainly
        didn't help motivate him, either.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, this led him to make a decision he would live to regret. Harry knew that Voldemort could plant
        false images in his brain and knew he shouldn’t trust anything he saw through Voldemort’s eyes. However,
        despite being told this multiple times by multiple people, he was compelled to go anyway – especially as
        this ‘skill’ had enabled him to save Arthur Weasley from Nagini. So, when Voldemort, planted the vision of
        Sirius being tortured in the Department of Mysteries, he decided it must be real. Although Harry meant well,
        his heart often ruled his head.</p>
    <p>As such, not only did he risk his own life, but he also risked his friends’ lives. If Harry hadn’t fallen for
        the set-up, then Sirius wouldn’t have come to the Ministry to rescue him – and we all know how that turned
        out. Ultimately, Voldemort created the perfect trap for Harry - knowing his emotions would outweigh the
        logic. Although a teenager shouldn't be outright blamed for something that Lord Voldemort manipulated,
        Harry’s tragic choice left him without his godfather but with a lifetime of regret.</p>
    <h2>1. Bartemius Crouch smuggling his son out of Azkaban</h2>
    <p>It may seem strange for us to say that this was the worst choice in the wizarding world – but hear us out. We
        believe if it wasn’t for Barty Crouch smuggling his son, Barty Crouch Jr, out of Azkaban, then Voldemort may
        not have returned.</p>
    <p>Barty Crouch may not have been aware of just how devastating the consequences would be when he decided to
        honour his dying wife’s wish. Yet, by freeing Barty Jr he set off a runaway train of events that culminated
        in that awful night of the third Triwizard task. If Barty Jr hadn’t been released, then he wouldn’t have
        managed to overpower his father, kidnap Mad-Eye Moody, take his place, enter Harry into the Triwizard
        Tournament, fix said tournament and finally ensure Harry was deposited in the graveyard where Wormtail could
        use his blood to resurrect the Dark Lord. As far as bad decisions go – this one was certainly up there.</p>

    <h1>Five reasons why we wish we could own a Niffler</h1>
    <p><i>Note: This article is borrowed from Wizarding World. You can see the original one <a
                href="https://www.wizardingworld.com/features/five-reasons-we-wished-we-owned-a-niffler">here</a>.</i>
    </p>
    <h3>Who doesn’t love a Niffler? These magical creatures are as mischievous as they are loveable. We’ve come up
        with five reasons why we wish we had one of our very own.</h3>
    <h3><b>Before we dive in, we just want to let you know there are a couple of spoilers for Fantastic Beasts: The
            Crimes of Grindelwald – so proceed with caution!</b></h3>
    <h2>Two words: Niffler babies</h2>
    <p>Nifflers are adorable. Everything about them is cute and squishy – from their tiny paws to their little
        snouts. Adult Nifflers are delightful, but the babies take it to a whole new level. When we meet them in The
        Crimes of Grindelwald, they are little balls of mischievous fluff that you just want to snuggle. Even though
        they had escaped from their home in Newt’s basement to cause chaos upstairs, we imagine he couldn’t stay mad
        at them for very long… we know we couldn’t.</p>
    <h2>They are excellent treasure hunters</h2>
    <p>Nifflers love all things shiny (who can really blame them) and are excellent at spotting anything potentially
        valuable. When we meet them for the very first time in Goblet of Fire, it is in one of Hagrid’s better Care
        of Magical Creatures lessons. Each student takes a Niffler and sends them digging for the gold coins Hagrid
        has hidden. They are so efficient Ron even queries whether he could have one for a pet. Though we wouldn’t
        recommend it – as nothing gets in the way of their search for treasure and they can be rather destructive.
        We’re not sure the furnishings in The Burrow could take it.</p>
    <h2>They are a constant source of entertainment</h2>
    <p>While it may not be intentional, there is no doubt that Nifflers are thoroughly entertaining. Who can forget
        the hilarious moment when someone managed to sneak one into Professor Umbridge’s office? Not only did it
        tear the room apart in its search for shiny things, but it even tried to take the rings from her fingers – a
        deeply satisfying moment for us all. Or what about the moment in Fantastic Beasts when Newt’s Niffler broke
        into a jewellery store and proceeded to cause (very cute) chaos? No matter the situation, you’re guaranteed
        to be amused if one of these furry little beasts are around, despite all the mess.</p>
    <h2>They can actually be helpful (sometimes)</h2>
    <p>Nifflers do have a reputation for only caring about twinkly things – but that isn’t strictly true. They can
        sometimes be helpful. In fact, it was Newt’s Niffler who managed to steal the blood pact from Grindelwald
        despite getting injured in the process. The vial may have been a super shiny pendant – but we still believe
        he knew it was more important than ordinary treasure. So yes, they may be little kleptomaniacs, but there is
        definitely more to them than that. We believe that they can be loyal and useful – if they’ve not been
        distracted by anything sparkly that is.</p>

    <h1>The cutest creatures of the wizarding world</h1>

    </p>
    <h2>While the wizarding world does come with its fair share of terrifying beasts (although Hagrid would beg to
        differ) there are more adorable magical creatures roaming around too. We’ve put together our favourites for
        you – just for a good mood boost.</h2>
    <h3>(And you’ll be pleased to know that Aragog and his Acromantula colony do not make the cut here.)</h3>
    <h2>The Mooncalf</h2>
    <p>Now, despite their spindly legs and webbed feet, there’s something about the Mooncalf and those big, bulging
        blue eyes that just warms our hearts. Mooncalves are also rather odd creatures, as they emerge from their
        burrows by the light of the full moon to perform ‘complicated’ dances that leave geometric patterns in wheat
        fields. However bizarre their hobbies may be, it’s safe to say that the Mooncalf definitely beats the
        werewolf as the cutest creature to come out at night.</p>

    <h2>Bowtruckles</h2>
    <p>Bowtruckles are not only quite sweet, but extremely useful little tree guardians. Newt Scamander found the
        creatures so fascinating that he kept one as a miniature sidekick in his pocket – named Pickett. Okay, so
        Pickett might be a little needy at times, but his loyalty to Newt is unparalleled. We admire that level of
        dedication.</p>
    <img

    <h2>Newt Scamander’s Niffler</h2>
    <p>Ah, the troublesome Niffler. Destructive, yet one of the fluffiest, cutest creatures in the wizarding world.
        Perhaps we’re drawn to their mischievous personalities, but Newt Scamander certainly isn’t the only one to
        have a special place in their heart for the little Niffler. We’d happily have one as a pet, even if it meant
        our precious items would most likely get stolen. The things we do for love.</p>

    <h2>Baby Norberta (aka Norbert the Norwegian Ridgeback)</h2>
    <p>We’re certain Ron would suggest we’ve lost our marbles to include Norberta in this list, but we just couldn’t
        leave her out. Previously known as Norbert, Hagrid’s baby dragon was one of the earliest magical creatures
        we ever met – so maybe that’s why this creature warmed the cockles of our heart. Or perhaps that’s just the
        fire-breathing. Of course, baby dragons are still extremely deadly with dangerously venomous fangs, but we
        still think they’re just as lovely as kittens. No, just us?</p>

    <h2>Pygmy Puffs</h2>
    <p>We have one stand-out reason for including Pygmy Puffs in this list: they’re just so fluffy. Bred as
        miniature versions of Puffskeins by the troublesome Fred and George Weasley, the violently pink and purple
        balls of fluff are one of the more innocent things you can buy at Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes. As if they’re
        not heart-warming enough on their own, did you know that the collective noun for a group of Puffskeins (or
        Pygmy Puffs) is called a poffle? A poffle!</p>
    <img
        src="https://www.theshopthatmustnotbenamed.co.uk/img/product/harry-potter-plush-pygmy-puff-purple-6073-600.jpg">
    <h2>Fluffy (while asleep only)</h2>
    <p>Speaking of things that are fluffy, we thought we’d also give a shout out to the three-headed dog with that
        exact name. All you’ve got to do is play him a bit of music and he falls right to sleep – how cute is that?
        We think this perilous canine from Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone was simply misunderstood.</p>
    <img
        src="https://images.ctfassets.net/usf1vwtuqyxm/2h9A38v707ZX9Ebij2ojA7/4781d7a87c705441bbcab52ba525031e/Fluffy_resized.jpg">
    <h2>Hippogriffs</h2>
    <p>And last but by no means least, we have another one of Hagrid’s pets, the Hippogriff. We meet the
        ever-endearing Buckbeak in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, where he immediately stole our hearts.
    </p>
    <p>Despite being rather dangerous (as Malfoy found out the hard way) if tamed by an expert, the Hippogriff can
        be one of the most loyal and helpful creatures – hence their rightful place on the list.</p>
    <img
        src="https://images.ctfassets.net/usf1vwtuqyxm/1HpFKPAQhCakGSS4MmySM8/d6f6b30aa545da9eca6aaf14ae5b66db/WB_F3_Buckbeak_HarryStrokesBuckbeaksHead_HP3-FX-226.jpg">
    <p>And there we have it. Our picks for the cutest creatures of the wizarding world – and we’re in a better mood
        already. Do you think we missed any that deserved a spot?</p>
